# Phase 1 Development Plan (In Progress)

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Kizofa platform development focuses on setting up the project structure, development environment, database configuration, and deployment pipelines. This document outlines our progress and what still needs to be completed.

## Tasks

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Project repository initialization (Kizofa_Monorepo already exists)
- ✅ Monorepo structure setup with apps/ and packages/ directories
- ✅ NestJS framework configuration with TypeScript
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality
- ✅ Git hooks setup with Husky and lint-staged
- ⬜ Unit and E2E testing infrastructure setup with Jest

### Database & Infrastructure
- ✅ Local development environment with MySQL and Redis (installed directly on macOS via Homebrew as Docker alternative)
- ✅ Prisma ORM initialization and configuration
- ✅ Initial database schema creation for user management
- ⬜ PlanetScale integration configuration for production database (requires GitHub account)
- ⬜ Database schema documentation
- ⬜ Security configurations for database access

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ⬜ GitHub account creation (required for all CI/CD and deployment tasks)
- ⬜ GitHub Actions workflows configuration:
  - CI workflow for testing and building on PRs
  - Deployment workflow for staging (develop branch)
  - Deployment workflow for production (main branch)
- ⬜ PlanetScale integration for database migrations
- ⬜ Environment variables and secrets management
- ⬜ Render deployment configuration for production (requires GitHub account)
- ⬜ Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- ⬜ Automated deployment triggers from GitHub Actions
- ⬜ CI/CD documentation and setup guide creation

### Core Application Structure
- ✅ Modular architecture following NestJS best practices
- ✅ Configuration management with environment variables
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Logging system with Winston
- ✅ API documentation with Swagger
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring
- ⬜ Feature flags system for managing features across environments

### Security Implementation
- ✅ Helmet for security headers
- ⬜ Throttler for rate limiting
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Input validation with class-validator
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ JWT secret management for secure authentication
- ⬜ Security documentation and best practices

### Testing Framework
- ⬜ Jest configuration for unit tests
- ⬜ E2E test setup with supertest
- ⬜ Test database configuration
- ⬜ Mocking utilities for services
- ⬜ Testing strategy documentation

## Current Progress

MySQL and Redis databases have been successfully installed directly on macOS using Homebrew as an alternative to Docker. The database connection has been tested and works properly with Prisma.

Winston logging system has been implemented and configured for both console and file logging. Logs are being captured for all application events.

Health check endpoints have been implemented using the @nestjs/terminus package. The health endpoints include checks for memory, disk, and database connectivity. These endpoints can be used for monitoring the application status in production.

JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing has been implemented. The authentication system includes:
- User registration with password hashing
- User login with JWT token generation
- JWT strategy for protected routes
- Input validation using class-validator
- Swagger documentation for authentication endpoints
- Error handling for validation errors and duplicate emails

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
2. Create a GitHub account (required for deployment infrastructure)
3. Set up PlanetScale for production database (requires GitHub account)
4. Configure Render for deployment (requires GitHub account)
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (requires GitHub account)
6. Implement feature flags system for managing features across environments

## Documentation To Be Created

The following documentation will be created:

- System architecture diagram
- API documentation (Swagger)
- Database schema documentation
- PlanetScale setup and migration guide
- Local development setup guide
- Deployment workflow documentation
- CI/CD setup guide
- Render deployment setup guide
- Testing strategy guide
- Security considerations and best practices
