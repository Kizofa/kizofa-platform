# Phase 1 Development Plan (In Progress)

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Kizofa platform development focuses on setting up the project structure, development environment, database configuration, and deployment pipelines. This document outlines our progress and what still needs to be completed.

## Tasks

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Project repository initialization (Kizofa_Monorepo already exists)
- ✅ Monorepo structure setup with apps/ and packages/ directories
- ✅ NestJS framework configuration with TypeScript
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality
- ✅ Git hooks setup with Husky and lint-staged
- ⬜ Unit and E2E testing infrastructure setup with Jest

### Database & Infrastructure
- ✅ Local development environment with MySQL and Redis (installed directly on macOS via Homebrew as Docker alternative)
- ✅ Prisma ORM initialization and configuration
- ✅ Initial database schema creation for user management
- ✅ PlanetScale integration configuration for production database (requires GitHub account)
- ✅ Database schema documentation
- ✅ Security configurations for database access

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ GitHub account creation (required for all CI/CD and deployment tasks)
- ✅ Git repository setup and configuration
- ✅ Initial codebase push to GitHub repository
- ✅ Render deployment configuration for production (requires GitHub account)
- ✅ Successful deployment to Render with proper environment setup
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows configuration:
  - ✅ CI workflow for testing and building on PRs
  - ✅ Deployment workflow for staging (develop branch)
  - ✅ Deployment workflow for production (main branch)
- ⬜ PlanetScale integration for database migrations
- ✅ Environment variables and secrets management
- ⬜ Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- ⬜ Automated deployment triggers from GitHub Actions
- ✅ CI/CD documentation and setup guide creation

### Core Application Structure
- ✅ Modular architecture following NestJS best practices
- ✅ Configuration management with environment variables
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Logging system with Winston
- ✅ API documentation with Swagger
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring
- ✅ Feature flags system for managing features across environments

### Security Implementation
- ✅ Helmet for security headers
- ✅ Throttler for rate limiting
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Input validation with class-validator
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ JWT secret management for secure authentication
- ✅ Security documentation and best practices

### Testing Framework
- ✅ Jest configuration for unit tests
- ⬜ E2E test setup with supertest
- ⬜ Test database configuration
- ✅ Mocking utilities for services
- ✅ Testing strategy documentation

## Current Progress

### Completed Items

#### Environment & Project Structure
- Successfully set up a monorepo structure with separate directories for backend, mobile, and admin applications
- Configured NestJS with TypeScript for the backend API
- Implemented code quality tools including ESLint and Prettier
- Set up Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit linting and formatting

#### Database Configuration
- Installed MySQL and Redis directly on macOS using Homebrew as an alternative to Docker
- Initialized and configured Prisma ORM for database access
- Created the initial database schema for user management and KYC
- Successfully connected to PlanetScale for production database hosting
- Modified Prisma schema for PlanetScale compatibility (relationMode="prisma")
- Created comprehensive database schema documentation

#### Authentication System
- Implemented JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Set up user registration with password validation
- Created login endpoint with JWT token generation
- Added JWT strategy for protected routes
- Implemented input validation using class-validator

#### Deployment
- Successfully set up a GitHub account and repository for version control
- Properly configured the Git repository with appropriate .gitignore and project structure
- Pushed the initial codebase to GitHub
- Created and configured a Render account for hosting the backend API
- Successfully deployed the backend to Render with proper environment variables
- Set up health check endpoints for monitoring application status
- Resolved native bcrypt binding issues in deployment by adding proper rebuild instructions
- Successfully tested the deployed API with health endpoints responding correctly

#### CI/CD
- Configured GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Set up separate workflows for staging and production deployments
- Implemented test coverage reporting
- Created comprehensive CI/CD documentation
- Created database migration workflow for PlanetScale integration

#### Security
- Implemented rate limiting with Throttler
- Created comprehensive security documentation
- Configured proper JWT secret management
- Implemented input validation and sanitization

#### Feature Management
- Implemented feature flags system for managing features across environments
- Created feature flags documentation
- Added feature flags endpoint for viewing current flag states
- Integrated feature flags with application services

#### Testing
- Set up Jest for unit testing
- Created sample unit tests for authentication service
- Implemented mocking utilities for services

### Next Steps

#### Priority Items for Phase 1 Completion
1. Implement PlanetScale integration for database migrations
2. Set up E2E testing infrastructure with supertest
3. Configure test database environment
4. Set up Docker containerization for consistent deployments

#### Additional Items
- Configure automated deployment triggers from GitHub Actions
- Enhance E2E test coverage
- Implement database migration workflows

## Notes

The backend API is now successfully deployed to Render and accessible at https://kizofa-api.onrender.com. The PlanetScale database is correctly configured and connected to the deployed application. We've made significant progress on the CI/CD pipeline, security implementation, and testing framework. The next critical steps involve setting up database migrations and E2E testing infrastructure.
